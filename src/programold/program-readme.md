# program that helps you map non-standard external display

## our process

in order to make it easier to map a non-standard display, we built a processing program that allows you to trace the displays and capture their location graphically and in text

## how to use

- draw rectangles creating the bounds for each display
- press C to output the drawing with the x and y values
  - mapping-XXX.png holds an image of the display
  - mapping_info.txt holds plaintext information about the display configuration
- press D to clear the rectangles
- press E to exit the program
